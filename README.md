# Learn C
### A brutally honest, work-in-progress course that will teach you C (if you don't quit first)

## ⚠️ Fair Warning: This Is Hard

**Learning C is not a casual weekend hobby.** Your code will segfault in ways that defy physics. You'll debug pointer arithmetic at 3 AM that should work but absolutely doesn't.

If you rage-quit after your first compiler error, this isn't for you. But if you're willing to grab yourself by your balls, put on your big boy pants, and push through the inevitable frustration, then welcome to the club. Don't bail at the first sign of difficulty. Give it a realshot, break some things, then decide if you want to quit.

You've been warned.

## What to Expect

There's this mystique around developers. You might picture me crafting this course in one night on my security-hardened ThinkPad while my custom-compiled kernel wards off three-letter agencies.

**Reality check:** I'm here with 47 browser tabs open—Claude AI (ensuring I'm first on the kill list when it takes over), the C reference manual, and increasingly desperate "why does my pointer segfault" forum posts. This is embarrassing considering the only code I've ever written was one Neovim plugin two years ago that probably doesn't work anymore.

**I LEARNED MOST OF THIS WHILE MAKING THIS COURSE!** My methodology? Read the manual, think "What the hell?", write code, fight with GCC for 20 minutes, segfault spectacularly, have my "aha!" moment at 2 AM.

Developers are impatient—I'm definitely one of them. My biggest mistake was lacking patience and abandoning projects halfway through or writing code I didn't understand. **Be realistic.** This won't make you a C wizard overnight. What it will give you: real concepts, practical tips, honest explanations—no snake oil, no "learn C in 24 hours" nonsense.

I don't make money from this; I just wanted to learn C before college and figured, why suffer alone?
