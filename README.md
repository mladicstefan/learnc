## What to Expect

There's a mystique around developers in general. You might picture me writing this course in one night from memory on my security-hardened ThinkPad, drinking artisanal coffee while my custom-compiled kernel wards off the Intel Management Engine and three-letter agencies. 

Reality check: I'm actually here on my Arch desktop (I use Arch btw) with 47 browser tabs open—Claude AI (ensuring I'm first on the kill list when it takes over), the C reference manual, and increasingly desperate "why does my pointer segfault" forum posts. This is especially embarrassing considering the only code I've ever written was one Neovim plugin two years ago that I'm pretty sure doesn't even work anymore. Oh, and my graphics driver just crashed while writing this sentence.

Let me be clear: **I LEARNED A LOT OF THIS WHILE MAKING THIS COURSE!** My methodology? Read the reference manual, think "What the hell is this?", write some code, fight with GCC for 20 minutes, write more code, segfault spectacularly, and only then have my "aha!" moment (usually at 2 AM). Developers are impatient people—I'll be honest, I'm definitely one of them. But a mistake I wish I'd recognized earlier was my lack of patience and my tendency to abandon projects halfway through or write code I didn't actually understand (see: that Neovim plugin). **Be realistic in your expectations.** This course won't make you a C wizard overnight. What it *will* give you: important concepts, useful tips, real-world problems to solve, and honest explanations of how things actually work—no snake oil, no "learn C in 24 hours" nonsense. I don't make money from this; I just wanted to learn C properly before college and figured, why suffer alone?
